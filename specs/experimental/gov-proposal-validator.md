## Overview

This document specifies the `ProposalValidator` contract, designed to enable permissionless proposals in the Optimism
governance system. The contract allows proposal submissions based on predefined rules and automated checks, removing the
need for manual gate-keeping.

## Design

The `ProposalValidator` manages the proposal lifecycle through three main actions:

- `Submit Proposal`: Records new proposals
- `Approve Proposal`: Handles proposal approvals
- `Move to Vote`: Transitions approved proposals to voting phase

The contract also integrates with EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) to verify authorized proposers for specific proposal
types. For detailed flows of each proposal, see [design docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/260).

## Roles

The contract has a single `owner` role (Optimism Foundation) with permissions to:

- Set the minimum approvals for each supported proposal type
- Configure voting cycle parameters
- Set maximum token distribution limits for proposals
- Checks the address of the attester for the submit proposal attestations with the address of the owner

## Interface

### Public Functions

`submitUpgradeProposal`

Submits a Protocol/Governor Upgrade or a Maintenance Upgrade proposal to move for voting.

`ProtocolOrGovernorUpgrade` proposal type will store the submission proposal data and will be able
to accept approvals by top delegates before being able to move for voting.

`MaintenanceUpgrade` proposal type can move straight to voting if all submission checks pass, unlike
the rest of the proposals where they need to collect a number of approvals by top delegates in order
to move to vote. This call should be atomic.

- MUST be called by an `owner` approved address
- MUST check if the proposal is a duplicate
- MUST use the `Optimistic` Voting Module
- MUST provide a valid againstThreshold
- MUST provide a valid attestation UID
- MUST NOT execute any operations
- MUST emit `ProposalSubmitted` and `ProposalVotingModuleData` events
- MUST store submission proposal data which are defined by the `ProposalSubmissionData` struct
- MUST move straight to vote IF `_proposalType` is `MaintenanceUpgrade`

```solidity
function submitUpgradeProposal(
    uint248 _againstThreshold,
    string memory _proposalDescription,
    bytes32 _attestationUid,
    ProposalType _proposalType
) external returns (bytes32 proposalHash_);
```

**Optimistic Voting Module**

Maintenance Upgrade proposals use the `Optimistic` voting module.

For the `ProposalSettings` of the voting module, these are:
- `uint248 againstThreshold`: Should be provided by the proposer. This value will be the percentage
that will be used to calculate the fraction of the votable supply that the proposal will need in votes in order
to pass.
- `bool isRelativeToVotableSupply`: Should always be `true`.
---

`submitCouncilMemberElectionsProposal`

Submits a Council Member Elections proposal for approval and voting.

- MUST be called by an `owner` approved address
- MUST check if the proposal is a duplicate
- MUST use the `Approval` Voting Module
- MUST use "TopChoices" criteria type for the Voting Module
- MUST provide a valid attestation UID
- MUST NOT execute any operations
- MUST emit `ProposalSubmitted` and `ProposalVotingModuleData` events
- MUST store submission proposal data which are defined by the `ProposalSubmissionData` struct

```solidity
function submitCouncilMemberElectionsProposal(
    uint128 _criteriaValue,
    string[] _optionDescriptions,
    string memory _proposalDescription,
    bytes32 _attestationUid
) external returns (bytes32 proposalHash_);
```

**Approval Voting Module**

Council Member Elections proposals use the `Approval` voting module.
This requires the user who submits the proposal to provide some additional data related to the proposal.

For the `ProposalSettings` of the voting module, these are:
- `uint128 criteriaValue`: Since the passing criteria type is "TopChoices" this number represents the amount
of top choices that can pass the voting.

For the `ProposalOptions` of the voting module, these are:
- `string[] optionDescriptions`: The strings of the different options that can be voted.
---

`submitFundingProposal`

Submits a `GovernanceFund` or `CouncilBudget` proposal type that transfers OP tokens for approval and voting.

- MUST only be called for `GovernanceFund` or `CouncilBudget` proposal type
- CAN be called by anyone
- MUST check if the proposal is a duplicate
- MUST use the `Approval` Voting Module
- MUST use "Threshold" criteria type for the Voting Module
- MUST use the `Predeploys.GOVERNANCE_TOKEN` and `IERC20.transfer` signature to create the `calldata`
for each option
- MUST NOT request to transfer more than `proposalDistributionThreshold` tokens
- MUST emit `ProposalSubmitted` event
- MUST store submission proposal data which are defined by the `ProposalSubmissionData` struct

```solidity
function submitFundingProposal(
    uint128 _criteriaValue,
    string[] _optionsDescriptions,
    address[] _optionsRecipients,
    uint256[] _optionsAmounts,
    string memory _description,
    ProposalType _proposalType,
) external returns (bytes32 proposalHash_);
```

**Approval Voting Module**

Funding proposals use the `Approval` voting module but unlike the Protocol or Governor upgrade proposals,
funding proposals need to execute token transfers.
This requires the user who submits the proposal to provide some additional data related to the proposal.

For the `ProposalSettings` of the voting module, these are:
- `uint128 criteriaValue`: Since the passing criteria type is always "Threshold", for this proposal type,
this value will be the percentage that will be used to calculate the fraction of the votable supply that
the proposal will need in votes in order to pass.

For the `ProposalOptions` of the voting module, these are:
- `string[] optionsDescriptions`: The strings of the different options that can be voted.
- `address[] optionsRecipients`: An address for each option to transfer funds to in case the option passes the voting.
- `uint256[] optionsAmounts`: The amount to transfer for each option in case the option passes the voting.
---

`approveProposal`

Approves a proposal before being moved for voting, used by the top delegates.

- MUST check if proposal hash corresponds to a valid proposal
- MUST check if caller has enough voting power to call the function and approve a proposal
  The voting power of the delegate is checked against a dynamic attestation service that
  updates the top100 delegates every day.
- MUST provide a valid attestation UID
- MUST check if the attestation has been revoked
- The attestation MUST refer to non partial delegation
- MUST check if caller has already approved the same proposal
- MUST store the approval vote
- MUST emit `ProposalApproved` when successfully called

```solidity
function approveProposal(bytes32 _proposalHash, bytes32 _attestationUid) external
```

Approving a funding proposal type requires extra attention to the budget amount and options, of the
approval voting module, that were provided on the submission of the proposal. This should be handled
by the Agora's UI.

---

`moveToVote`

Checks if the provided proposal is ready to move for voting. Based on the Proposal Type different checks are being
validated. If all checks pass then `OptimismGovernor.proposeWithModule` is being called to forward the proposal for voting.

- MUST create the `proposalHash` and check if it exists and is valid
- Proposal MUST have gathered equal or more than the `requiredApprovals` defined for that type
- MUST check if proposal has already moved for voting
- MUST emit `ProposalMovedToVote` event

For `ProtocolOrGovernorUpgrade` type:

- MUST also check that is called by the proposer that submitted the proposal
- `_optionsRecipients` and `_optionsAmounts` MUST be empty

For `MaintenanceUpgradeProposals` type:

- This type does not require any checks and is being forwarded to the Governor contracts, this should happen atomically.

For `CouncilMemberElections` type:

- MUST also check that is called by the proposer that submitted the proposal
- `_optionsRecipients` and `_optionsAmounts` MUST be empty
- Proposal MUST be moved to vote during a valid voting cycle

For `GovernanceFund` and `CouncilBudget` types:

- Proposal MUST be moved to vote during a valid voting cycle
- MUST check if the total amount of tokens that can possible be distributed during this voting cycle does not go over the
  `VotingCycleData.votingCycleDistributionLimit`

```solidity
function moveToVote(
    uint128 _criteriaValue,
    address[] memory _optionsRecipients,
    uint256[] memory _optionsAmounts,
    string[] memory _optionDescriptions,
    string memory _proposalDescription
) external returns (uint256 proposalHash_)
```

---

`canApproveProposal`

Returns true if a delegate is part of the top100 delegates based on the dynamic attestation service.

- Can be called by anyone
- MUST return TRUE if the delegate is part of the top100 and can approve a proposal

```solidity
function canApproveProposal(address _delegate, bytes32 _attestationUid) public view returns (bool canApprove_)
```

---

`setVotingCycleData`

Sets the voting cycle data.

- MUST only be called by the owner of the contract
- MUST NOT change an existing voting cycle
- MUST emit `VotingCycleSet` event

```solidity
function setVotingCycleData(
    uint256 _cycleNumber,
    uint256 _startBlock,
    uint256 _duration,
    uint256 _distributionLimit
) external
```

---

`setProposalDistributionThreshold`

Sets the maximum distribution amount a proposal can request.

- MUST only be called by the owner of the contract
- MUST change the previous amount to the new one
- MUST emit `ProposalDistributionThresholdSet` event

```solidity
function setProposalDistributionThreshold(uint256 _threshold) external
```

---

`setProposalTypeApprovalThreshold`

Sets the number of approvals a specific proposal type should have before being able to move for voting.

- MUST only be called by the owner of the contract
- MUST change the previous value to the new one
- MUST emit `ProposalTypeApprovalThresholdSet` event

```solidity
function setProposalTypeApprovalThreshold(
    uint8 _proposalTypeId,
    uint256 _approvalThreshold
) external
```

### Properties

- Maintenance Upgrades
- Council Member Elections
- Governance Funding
- Council Budget

    address indexed proposer,
    string description,
    ProposalType proposalType
);
```

MUST be triggered when `moveToVote` is successfully called.

```solidity
event ProposalMovedToVote(uint256 indexed proposalHash, address indexed executor);
```

`ProposalVotingModuleData`

MUST be triggered with `ProposalSubmitted` event.

```solidity
event ProposalVotingModuleData(uint256 indexed proposalHash, bytes encodedVotingModuleData);
```

## EAS Integration

`ProposalValidator` integrates Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to handle proposer authorization for specific
`ProposalType`s, and authentication of the top100 delegates for approving a proposal, removing the need for adding
custom logic to the contract.

## Why EAS?

- **Decentralized trust**: Instead of custom logic, Optimism uses attestations signed by the Foundation to authorize
  proposers.
- **Low integration overhead**: `EAS` and `SchemaRegistry` are predeploys on Optimism, requiring no additional deployments
  or infrastructure.
- **Schema validation**: Ensures attestations follow strict data formats (e.g. `address approvedDelegate, uint8 proposalType`).
- **Revocability and expiration**: EAS supports expiration and revocation semantics natively, allowing dynamic control over
  authorized proposers.

## Implementation Details

### Submit Proposal

For the submit proposals we will need to register a new schema as described at `ATTESTATION_SCHEMA_UID_APPROVED_PROPOSERS`.
The submit proposal functions validates attestations by:
- Ensuring the attestation UID matches the registered schema.
- Verifying the attester is the contract owner (Optimism Foundation).
- Decoding the attestation to check the proposer's address and proposal type.
- Only proposals of type `ProtocolOrGovernorUpgrade`, `MaintenanceUpgradeProposals`, and `CouncilMemberElections`
require valid EAS attestations.

### Approve Proposal

For the top100 delegates we will be using an existing schema that was created by the [dynamic attestation service](https://github.com/CuriaLab/dynamic_attestation_mvp).
The approve proposal function validates attestations by:
- Ensuring the attestation UID matches the registered schema.
- Verifying the attester is the contract owner (Optimism Foundation).
- Decoding the attestation to check the targets address.

**Technical implementation docs: [EAS Integration](https://www.notion.so/EAS-Integration-1de9a4c092c780478e19cc8175aa054e?pvs=21)**

## Proposal uniqueness

To prevent duplicate proposals, the contract enforces uniqueness by hashing the defining parameters of each proposal and
checking against a registry of previously submitted proposals, creating a proposalId. The proposal ID should be the same
as the one created on `Governor.hashProposalWithModule` and used by the `Voting Modules`.

A proposal is uniquely identified by a tuple:

- `proposalValidator`: The address of the proposal validator
- `module`: The address of the voting module the proposal uses
- `proposalVotingModuleData`: The encoded voting module data
- `descriptionHash`: The hash of the description

These elements are ABI-encoded and hashed:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encode(proposalValidator, module, proposalVotingModuleData, descriptionHash));
```

This hash serves as a unique identifier for the proposal. The contract stores submitted proposals in:

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => ProposalSubmissionData) private _proposals;
```

When a new proposal is submitted, the contract checks that `_proposals[proposalHash]` is empty (e.g., `proposer ==
address(0)`). If data exists at that key, the proposal is rejected as a duplicate.

This mechanism guarantees that proposals with the same intent and execution logic cannot be submitted multiple times,
maintaining proposal integrity and preventing spam.

## Invariants

- It MUST allow only the `owner` to set the `votingCycleData`, `proposalDistributionThreshold`, and
  `proposalTypeApprovalThreshold`
- It MUST only allow eligible addresses to approve a proposal
- It MUST only allow authorized addresses to submit proposals for types `ProtocolOrGovernorUpgrade`,
  `MaintenanceUpgradeProposals`, and `CouncilMemberElections`
- It MUST NOT transfer any tokens or ETH for `ProtocolOrGovernorUpgrade`, `MaintenanceUpgradeProposals`, and
  `CouncilMemberElections` proposal types
- It MUST emit the following events:
  - `ProposalSubmitted`
  - `ProposalApproved`
  - `ProposalMovedToVote`

## Security Considerations

- **Role-Based Restrictions:** The `owner` role should be securely managed, as it holds critical permissions such as
  configuring voting cycles, and distribution limits. Any compromise could significantly impact governance.
- **Attestation Validation:** Two key aspects need consideration:
  - The Optimism Foundation must have a secure and thorough process for validating addresses before issuing attestations
    for specific proposal types
  - The contract must properly verify attestation expiration and revocation status to prevent the use of outdated or
    invalid attestations
- **Dynamic Attestation Service:** Since we rely on the dynamic attestation service for updating the top100 delegates
  we need to ensure that the service will be running and updating the attestations at least during the governance cycles.
