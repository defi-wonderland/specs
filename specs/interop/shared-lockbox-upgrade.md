## Overview

Based on the assumption that a chain joining the dependency set is an irreversible process,
the on-chain chains list is simplified by assuming that joining the Shared Lockbox is
equivalent to joining the op-governed dependency set.

The migration process consists of three main points:

- Add the chain to the op-governed dependency set
- Move ETH liquidity from `OptimismPortal` to `SharedLockbox`
- Upgrade the code of `OptimismPortal` to include the `SharedLockbox` integration

The migration process also requires that:

- `SharedLockbox` is deployed
- `SuperchainConfig` is upgraded to manage the dependency set
- `SystemConfig` is upgraded to the interop contract version

### Add the chain to the op-governed dependency set

The `SuperchainConfig` contract will be responsible for storing and managing the dependency set.
Its `addChain` function will add a chain to the dependency set and call the `SystemConfig` of each chain
to keep them in sync.
It will also allowlist the corresponding `OptimismPortal`, enabling it to lock and unlock ETH from the `SharedLockbox`.
Once this process is complete, the system will be ready to process deposits and withdrawals.

### Migrate ETH liquidity from `OptimismPortal` to `SharedLockbox`

The ETH will be transferred from the `OptimismPortal` to the `SharedLockbox` using an intermediate contract.
This contract functions similarly to upgrades using the `StorageSetter`, being updated immediately before to the real implementation.
Its sole purpose is to transfer the ETH balance.
This approach eliminates the need for additional code to move the liquidity to the lockbox later.

#### `LiquidityMigrator`

This contract is meant to be used as an intermediate step for the liquidity migration.
Its unique purpose is to transfer the whole ETH balance from `OptimismPortal` to `SharedLockbox`.
This approach avoids adding extra code to the `initialize` function, which could be prone to errors in future updates.

**Interface and properties**

**`migrateETH`**

Transfers the entire ETH balance from the `OptimismPortal` to the `SharedLockbox`.

- It MUST transfer the whole ETH balance to the `SharedLockbox` when called.

```solidity
function migrateETH() external;
```

### `OptimismPortal` code upgrade

The `OptimismPortal` will start locking and unlocking ETH through the `SharedLockbox`.
It will continue to handle deposits and withdrawals but won't directly hold the ETH liquidity.
To set this up, the upgrade function will be called via `ProxyAdmin` to implement the new code,
which includes the necessary `SharedLockbox` integration.
The `SharedLockbox` address will be set during the `initialize` function. After this step,
the `OptimismPortal` will not be able to process deposits and withdrawals until the chain is registered
in `SuperchainConfig`.

## Batch transaction process

The approach consists of handling the entire migration process in a single batched transaction.
This transaction will include:

1. Call `addChain` in the `SuperchainConfig`
   - Sending chain ID + system config address
2. Call `upgradeAndCall` in the `ProxyAdmin` for the `OptimismPortal`
   - Update provisionally to the `LiquidityMigrator` to transfer the whole ETH balance to the `SharedLockbox` in this call.
3. Call `upgrade` in the `ProxyAdmin` for the `OptimismPortal`
   - The `SharedLockbox` address is set as immutable in the new implementation

The L1 ProxyAdmin owner (L1PAO) will execute this transaction. As the entity responsible for updating contracts,
it has the authority to perform the first two steps.
For the third step, the L1PAO has to be set as authorized for adding a chain to the op-governed dependency set
on the `SuperchainConfig` when initializing.
This process can be set as a [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops) task.

    participant L1PAO as L1 ProxyAdmin Owner
    participant ProxyAdmin as ProxyAdmin
    participant SuperchainConfig
    participant OptimismPortalProxy as OptimismPortal
    participant LiquidityMigrator
    participant SharedLockbox

    Note over L1PAO: Start batch

    %% Step 1: Add chain to SuperchainConfig
    L1PAO->>SuperchainConfig: addChain(chainId, SystemConfig address)

    %% Step 2: Upgrade OptimismPortal to intermediate implementation that transfers ETH
    L1PAO->>ProxyAdmin: upgradeAndCall()
    ProxyAdmin->>OptimismPortalProxy: Upgrade to LiquidityMigrator
    OptimismPortalProxy->>LiquidityMigrator: Call migrateETH()
    OptimismPortalProxy->>SharedLockbox: Transfer entire ETH balance

    %% Step 3: Upgrade OptimismPortal to final implementation
    L1PAO->>ProxyAdmin: upgrade()
    ProxyAdmin->>OptimismPortalProxy: Upgrade to new OptimismPortal implementation

    Note over L1PAO: End batch
```

## Future Considerations / Additional Notes

- Before calling `addChain`, it MUST be ensured that the `chainId` and `systemConfig` match
